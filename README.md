Toy webGL 3D Renderer with Portals
----------------------------------

This is an experimental 3D renderer for webGL designed for ray-tracing non-Euclidean space with portals.

I wrote this mainly as a toy, to practice writing webGL shaders and to learn more about moving vectors around
using affine transformations (that's how the portals work).

As this was for my own amusement, please do not consider this as a good example of the use of JavaScript or GLSL code.

Start a web server with something like `python3 -m http.server`. You can move around with the WASD keys.
